# Unique Usernames Plugin

Saves the username of each joined user and prohibits impersonations.

Does require your server to have a database!

## How to use

Simply copy both files ``UniqueUsernamesPlugin.jar`` and ``unique-usernames-config.json`` into your ``<server-folder>/config/mods`` directory

In ``unique-usernames-config.json`` the settings for your database connection must be specified.
